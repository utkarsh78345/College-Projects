## 📘 Project Overview

The **Library Management System (LMS)** is a software application designed to efficiently manage the operations of a library. It helps both librarians and users perform tasks such as issuing books, returning books, managing catalogs, and maintaining membership records. By computerizing these tasks, the system aims to reduce manual work, improve accuracy, and deliver faster services.
